Shelly Shell!

### challenge-description
Next letâ€™s do some hunting for anything that might be backdoor or shell related. Review the process stack for low frequency processes and see if you can find something evil! 

Supply the MD5 hash of one of the backdoors. 

Note: When you stack data you only get some of the columns, if you find something interesting, search/grep through all the host csv documents to find additional data on that process. 

Example: WinRAR.exe appears in the stack with a count of 1. Using Powershell or Bash, search the ProcWMI directory for WinRAR to get the full data from the host.

Powershell: cat * | Select-String 'WinRAR'
Bash: grep --recursive --fixed-string 'WinRAR'

Showing the MD5 to be - A48464D7F5621168BBB92233544CF8C4

Flag Example:
flag{A48464D7F5621168BBB92233544CF8C4}

## flag
