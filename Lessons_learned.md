# Lessons Learned Fall 2020

- Do not make challenges dependent on each other
- Timestamp stuff is annoying but people got it in the end.
- Having a narrative is fine, more detail in the challenge descriptions the better. 
- - just dont link the challenges.
- Pre-parse stuff. They dont have time.

# Lessons Learned Spr 2021

- For the easy challenges, either only provide the single artifact, or point directly to it. Let the analysis be the challenge.
- Do not depend on multi-file / location challenges until harder challenges.
- Ask multiple questions about the same data source.
- For CNY they dont have enough time to parse/find artifacts.
- Specific questions about specific data
- Start making boxes weeks/months in advance. Important to have on hand.
- Having a dev / prod / playground of machines is great system.

# Lessons Learned Fall 2021

- If you are going to modify .md files in sublime, make sure you save them before committing. That's embarrassing.
- Before I said 'Do not make challenges dependent on each other' now I disagree. Its fine as long as you factor in that itâ€™ll make things harder. A final challenge can be dependent on challenges before.
